# ECE387_Chip_Interface

## Introduction
    This project is about interfacing with a chosen chip as part of an individual class project. I have chosen to interface with a radio tranceiver. I will be using an Arduino microcontroller and an RFM22B with a breakout board purchased [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10154). My goal for now is to successfully receive a transmission from the chip using an [RTL-SDR](http://www.rtl-sdr.com/) as a receiver.
